    <h1>Snake is Back!</h1>

    <br />
    <p>
      The world is once again threatened by ex-cia operatives known as
      XOF. They have the technology to mass produce nukes and plan to make them
      widely available. Would Snake be able to stop this for once and for all?
      (Course not)

        <h3>Crappy Story!</h3>

          I tried reading up on the history of this game and found the story to be just a jumbled mess written by a completely amateur, hack writer. By the time I finished I was having a hard time keeping track of who is double-crossing who and why they would even want to do that. This is coming from someone who absolutely adores classic literature and complex plots.
  
          This game makes Game of Thrones look like a writing masterpiece (it's not, really) because at least there you at least have some context for why someone is doing something bad.
          
         
          
          The dialogue, besides, is horrific... just... oh my god... things like:
  
          <hr>
          
          "You too have known loss, and that loss torments you still. You hope hatred might someday replace the pain, but it never goes away. It makes a man hideous, inside and out. Wouldn't you agree? We both are demons. Our humanity won't return."
          
          <hr>
  
          REALLY now.. can anyone tell me they listened to this without an audible groan or eye-roll?
          
          It's the video game writing equivalent of Fifty Shades of Gray, with terrible purple prose ridden writing and shameless pandering to lonely, sad dudes who get off on "boob physics". This is why games aren't taken very seriously as a narrative medium, because the games that sell millions of copies get away with stories that even a casual observer would think are absolutely ridiculous.
